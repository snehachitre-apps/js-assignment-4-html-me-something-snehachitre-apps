              <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> Hi, I am Sneha ! 
                
                <br />Welcome to my page, where I briefly introduce my interests. I like to dabble in new interests. Some interests have stayed with me for a long time, some have faded away.. Well, life happens, dosen't it?! In short, I think of me as: &quot;Jack of all trades, but master of none&quot; ! And I am proud to be so, as I get to explore and experience more. 
             
                <br />P.S. Hobbies are not in a particular order..in case you were wondering.

                  <h2>Acrylic Painting</h2>
                  <p>I got into acrylic painting when I was living in New Jersey with a roommate. She introduced me to  Painting classes called Pinot's Palette! I started going there and I learned a few painting techniques. They are pretty cool people who teach absolute beginners like me acrylic painting step-by-step. All you need to do is go to their website, pick what you want to paint,  and pay for the class.  They provide the materials and step by step instructions, and you get to take home the canvas you painted. You can see one of the paintings I created below. It was a lot of fun and mainly it was so satisfying to see the end product - a beautiful art that you made yourself. I later also learned art of pour painting, which creates captivating abstract patterns on canvas.

                  <h2>Sketching</h2>
                  <p>Sketching has been my hobby since childhood. I think I inherited this hobby from my mom. She is way more talented at all the artistic talents like sewing, embroidary, sketching, patchwork, crochet etc. I like to sketch mostly still-life, or anime characters. You can see some of basic Anime artworks below. I hope to improve this hobby as it is very therapatic just like painting. </p>

                  <h2>Travelling</h2>
                  <p>Oh, travelling, my soul.  Although I have not been travelling as much as I would love to now, due to #life, I have a travelled a considerable amount when I was in India. My parents have wandering feet, and they have taken me to a lot of memorable vacations across multiple states in India.  I have been really blessed to experience different cultures and different foods each state offers, along with the amazing sights, rich architectures and undestanding stories behind them. I remember, when I was a kid, my father planned out entire trip on a physical map, based on the newspaper articles he gathered over time. Google was non-existent then! A lot of hard work went behind planning an excellent trip for your family. I really appreciate the efforts he put to show me the world.</p>

                  <h2>Photography</h2>
                  <p>Photography generally follows hand-in-hand with travelling, I would say. I credit this interest to my father. He owned, [a now vintage] Pentax 1000 metal body camera with rolls. He has an eye for photo composition, and never had to waste rolls. All the photos he took would come out perfect after developing them. We did not have luxury of immediately checking the pictures like today's DSLRS! 
                    <br/> Anyway, that's how my interests in photography sparked. I still have a lot to learn. I generally like to click landscapes, portaits, macro photography, street photography, and someday I want to dabble into astrophotography. Currently I own a humble DSLR:

                  <h2>Hiking</h2>
                  <p>Hiking is an interest I developed during travelling. Back in India, I loved to climbed the mountains. I also did a small course on rock-climbing, and river-crossing. In USA, I had many opportunities to hike beautiful mountains, for example Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountains, etc. It is scary to climb, but the views are always worth it !</p>

                  <h2>Astronomy</h2>
                  <p> I LOVE to look at the night sky! I have done basic astronomy course, and know how to operate a telescope. I currently own a astronomical binoculars. I was active member of oldest amateur astronomy institute in India, called 
                    <em>&quot;Jyotirvidya Parisanstha&quot;, where I participated in various social events like stargazing sessions, astronomy exhibitions, lecture series, etc.</em>In Kansas City, I am proud new member of ASKC and love Powell Observatory.

                  <h2>Reading</h2>
                  <p>This interest has faded now due to #life again, but I generally love to read genres such as self-help, sci-fi, adventure, mystery, and some select fiction. Every book I read, adds some perspective into my thinking, so it is really hard to pick any favourites.</p>

                  <h2>Taekwondo</h2>
                  <p>Taekwondo is LOVE. I fell in love with the sport when I was in 6th Grade. I randomly saw some kids practicing in my residential complex, and I immediately wanted to be part of it ! I pursued till brown belt back in India, and unfortunately stopped due to some personal reasons. I started back from white belt back in USA, in American Taekwondo, back in Arlington, TX. My school, Mike Johnson's Texas Black Belt Academy, is best! I have moved cities due to job, but I never found a school as good as I find home school! It is a family indeed. I have learned a lot of practical life lessons there, apart from Taekwondo lessons!</p>

                  <h2>Watching Anime and K-Dramas</h2>
                  <p> I love to watch Anime and K-dramas in my free time now. I am no OTAKU. I got into watching Anime long after sketching the characters. So far my favourite is Naruto. In k-dramas, I love the dramas with genres: Sci-fi, fictional/supernatural, romantic, law, and crime/detective dramas. </p>
